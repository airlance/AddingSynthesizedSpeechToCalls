# Adding synthesized speech to calls
Provide a more accessible experience by adding your appâ€™s audio to a call.

## Overview
This sample project shows you how to create an accessibility app that supports augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) by adding synthesized speech to a call. This feature is available in iOS 18.2 and visionOS 2.2 and later, and is available to use with calling apps that capture microphone input using Apple's voice processing like Phone, FaceTime, and most VoIP apps.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
[Adding synthesized speech to calls](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/adding-synthesized-speech-to-calls) in the developer documentation.
